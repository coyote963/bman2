# Weapon Menu Branch
This branch is for the weapon switching system at the main menu.
Each weapon will be on a separate radio button in a button group.

### Things to note as of 2 / 14 / 2024
- The actual linking of the buttons to weapons isn't completed yet; currently the buttons on the main menu do nothing.

### Ideas as of 2 / 14 / 2024
- Possibly use a MenuButton or OptionButton to reduce visual clutter with high weapon count?
